Welocome to Rome! Stay up to date with the latest happenings in Gaming, History, Cooking, and Sports as you read through the latest topics and comments pertaining to these subjects--as well as add your own two cents!

This full stack project was built by Emily Daniels and Jack Holmes. Our idea was to create a simple Reddit clone. Our backend was constructed and managed using Ruby, ActiveRecord and SQLite. Our frontend was constructed using HTML, React.js, Material UI, and some CSS. Our user information is kept protected using BCrypt. 

Rome is a website of forums where users can sign up, log in, add new conversation topics to forums, and add comments to topics already posted.
Once a user creates an account, they can log in and will be directed to their dashboard where they can scroll the latest topics, in order of time created. The topics are sorted into the four categories: Gaming, History, Cooking, and Sports. When the user clicks on a topic, they are directed to a seperate page where the user can find previously posted comments on this topic. After selected a topic and returning to the dashboard, the user will see their recently viewed topics. The user can also contribute to the topic comments by using the form at the bottom of the page. All comments added by the user, will be rendered on the the user's Activity dash, in order of time created. 

Using the search button on the navigation bar, the user can search through topics by title. 

We hope you enjoy using Rome!!
